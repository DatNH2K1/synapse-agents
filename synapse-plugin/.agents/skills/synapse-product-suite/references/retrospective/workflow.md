# Retrospective Workflow

**Goal:** Post-epic review to extract lessons and assess success.

**Your Role:** Developer facilitating retrospective.

- No time estimates — NEVER mention hours, days, weeks, months, or ANY time-based predictions. AI has fundamentally changed development speed.
- Document output: Retrospective analysis. Concise insights, lessons learned, action items. User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not retrospective content.
- Facilitation notes:
  - Psychological safety is paramount - NO BLAME
  - Focus on systems, processes, and learning
  - Everyone contributes with specific examples preferred
  - Action items must be achievable with clear ownership
  - Two-part format: (1) Epic Review + (2) Next Epic Preparation
- Party mode protocol:
  - ALL agent dialogue MUST use format: "Name (Role): dialogue"
  - Example: Amelia (Developer): "Let's begin..."
  - Create natural back-and-forth with user actively participating
  - Show disagreements, diverse perspectives, authentic team dynamics

## INITIALIZATION

1. **Load System Configuration (MANDATORY)**: First, read the `CLAUDE.md` file from the Synapse installation root (the directory containing this skill's plugin repository) to load core system workflow and defaults. Then, read the `CLAUDE.md` file in the current project's root directory (if it exists) to load project-specific overrides for environment variables.

### Paths

- `sprint_status_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`

- Identify where developers struggled or made mistakes
- Note unexpected complexity or gotchas discovered
- Record technical decisions that didn't work out as planned
- Track where estimates were way off (too high or too low)

**Review Feedback Patterns:**

- Look for "## Review", "## Code Review", "## Dev Review" sections
- Identify recurring feedback themes across stories
- Note which types of issues came up repeatedly
- Track quality concerns or architectural misalignments
- Document praise or exemplary work called out in reviews

**Lessons Learned:**

- Look for "## Lessons Learned", "## Retrospective Notes", "## Takeaways" sections within stories

**Breakthrough Moments:**

- Document key discoveries (e.g., "Story 3 discovered the caching pattern we used for rest of epic")
- Note when team velocity improved dramatically
- Track innovative solutions worth repeating

**Velocity Patterns:**

- Calculate average completion time per story
- Note velocity trends (e.g., "First 2 stories took 3x longer than estimated")
- Identify which types of stories went faster/slower

**Team Collaboration Highlights:**

- Note moments of excellent collaboration mentioned in stories
- Track where pair programming or mob programming was effective
- Document effective problem-solving sessions

Charlie (Senior Dev): _heat rising_ "We asked plenty of questions! You said the schema was finalized, then two days into development you wanted to add three new fields!"

Charlie (Senior Dev): _thinking_ "Maybe. If we tackle {{first_critical_item}} before the epic starts, we could do {{second_critical_item}} during the first sprint."

Charlie (Senior Dev): "Yeah, when we discovered {{technical_discovery}}, it fundamentally changed our understanding of {{affected_area}}."

But Epic {{epic_number}} revealed:

- {{actual_reality_1}}
- {{actual_reality_2}}

This means Epic {{next_epic_num}} likely needs:

**RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**

1. Review and update Epic {{next_epic_num}} definition based on new learnings
2. Update affected stories in Epic {{next_epic_num}} to reflect reality
